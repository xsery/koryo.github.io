Welcome to Cursed game wiki!

Cursed is based on the infinity run concept where the player walk throught obstacles and gathering items. The concept originated in May 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early 2014. It was criticized for its level of difficulty and alleged plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded free game in the iOS App Store. During this period, its developer claimed that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements as well as sales.

## Gameplay
The player controls a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective was to direct a flying cursed girl, named "Lilly",[6] who moves continuously to the right, between sets of tree trunks. If the player falls outside the tree trunk, game over. Lilly briefly jumps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Lilly falls because of gravity; each pair of trunks that she navigates between earns the player a single point, with potions awarded for the score at the end of the game.
